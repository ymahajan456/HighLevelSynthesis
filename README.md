# HighLevelSynthesis

As the name of the project suggests, the project aims at performing high-level synthesis on an input
expression written in a high-level format to generate the hardware level code in the VHDL and
some graphical representations for easier viewing. It goes through the processes of Scheduling, Binding
and Allocation on a tree produced from the input infix expression while optimizing, based on the
constraints on the timing and resources to generate an internal representation. This is then worked upon
further to generate a synthesizable VHDL component which can be used by the user to perform the
operation as desired.

Right now the project is in initial stage and we are open for new ideas and will be very pleased by your contribution.
